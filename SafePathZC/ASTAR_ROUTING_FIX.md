# A\* Routing Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The A\* pathfinding algorithm was failing because the road network was **highly fragmented** with disconnected clusters. Only 0.02% of nodes were reachable from typical start points.

## Root Cause

The GeoJSON road data has separate LineString features for each road segment. At intersections, the endpoints of different segments don't share exact coordinates - they can be 10-50 meters apart due to GPS inaccuracies or data processing.

## Solution Applied

**Increased intersection connection threshold from 15m to 50m** in `backend/services/local_routing.py`:

```python
connection_threshold = 50.0  # meters - increased to bridge larger gaps at intersections
```

## Results

- **Before**: 14,264 intersection connections, 0.02% network reachability
- **After**: 59,776 intersection connections, full network connectivity
- **Route calculation**: ✓ SUCCESS with 625 waypoints

## Files Modified

1. `backend/services/local_routing.py`:

   - Line ~365: Increased `connection_threshold` from 15.0 to 50.0 meters
   - Added debug logging to A\* algorithm
   - Improved `_get_segment_neighbors()` to explore cross-segment connections

2. `frontend/src/components/MapView.tsx`:
   - Removed all fallback route generation
   - Now properly throws errors when backend fails
   - Error handling delegates to UI instead of creating fake routes

## Testing

Run test: `python backend/test_simple.py`
Expected: "✓ SUCCESS! Route with 625 points"

## Next Steps

**RESTART THE BACKEND SERVER** for changes to take effect:

```bash
cd C:\xampp\htdocs\2025-CP-SafePathZamboanga\SafePathZC\backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload
```

Then test in the browser - routes should now follow actual roads!
