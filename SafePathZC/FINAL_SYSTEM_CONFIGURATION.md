# âœ… FINAL SYSTEM CONFIGURATION - October 26, 2025

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. **OSRM Now Uses zcroadmap.geojson**
- âœ… Rebuilt OSRM routing engine with `zcroadmap.geojson` (11,982 roads)
- âœ… OSRM routes will now **precisely follow your actual roads**
- âœ… Updated `docker-compose.yml` to use `zamboanga_roads.osrm` (CH algorithm)

### 2. **Flood Analysis Uses terrain_roads.geojson**
- âœ… Backend analyzes routes against `terrain_roads.geojson` for flood risk
- âœ… 6,585 flooded roads identified
- âœ… Accurate flood percentage calculations

### 3. **Road Snapping Implemented**
- âœ… Added `snap_route_to_roads()` function in `services/local_routing.py`
- âœ… OSRM routes are snapped to nearest road geometries (within 30m)
- âœ… Prevents routes from cutting corners or going off-road

## Data Flow

```
User clicks 2 points on map
         â†“
Frontend sends coordinates to backend
         â†“
Backend queries OSRM (uses zcroadmap.geojson roads)
         â†“
OSRM returns 3 alternative routes
         â†“
Backend snaps routes to road geometries
         â†“
Backend analyzes each route against terrain_roads.geojson
         â†“
Routes classified: Safe, Manageable, Flood-Prone
         â†“
Frontend displays 3 color-coded routes
```

## Files Overview

### GeoJSON Data
1. **`backend/data/zcroadmap.geojson`** (11,982 roads)
   - Used by: OSRM routing engine
   - Contains: Complete road network with highway classification
   - Purpose: Accurate route calculation

2. **`backend/data/terrain_roads.geojson`** (11,675 roads)
   - Used by: Backend flood analysis
   - Contains: 6,585 flooded roads with elevation data
   - Purpose: Flood risk assessment

### OSRM Data
- **`backend/osrm-data/zamboanga_roads.osrm`** + related files
  - Built from: `zcroadmap.geojson`
  - Algorithm: CH (Contraction Hierarchies)
  - Nodes: 120,579
  - Ways: 11,982

### Key Code Files
1. **`backend/services/local_routing.py`**
   - `get_routing_service()` â†’ loads zcroadmap.geojson
   - `get_flood_service()` â†’ loads terrain_roads.geojson
   - `snap_route_to_roads()` â†’ snaps OSRM routes to actual roads
   - `analyze_route_flood_risk()` â†’ calculates flood percentages

2. **`backend/main.py`**
   - `get_osrm_route()` â†’ calls OSRM + applies road snapping
   - `get_osrm_route_with_waypoints()` â†’ handles waypoint routes + snapping

3. **`backend/docker-compose.yml`**
   - OSRM container configured to use `zamboanga_roads.osrm`
   - Port 5000 for driving routes
   - Port 5001 for walking routes

## How to Start Everything

### 1. Start Docker Services (OSRM + Database)
```powershell
cd c:\xampp\htdocs\2025-CP-SafePathZamboanga\SafePathZC
docker-compose up
```
**Expected output:**
```
safepath-osrm-driving | [info] Listening on: 0.0.0.0:5000
safepath-osrm-walking | [info] Listening on: 0.0.0.0:5000
```

### 2. Start Backend (FastAPI)
```powershell
cd c:\xampp\htdocs\2025-CP-SafePathZamboanga\SafePathZC\backend
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001
```
**Expected output:**
```
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8001
âœ“ Routing service loaded with 11982 road segments from zcroadmap.geojson
âœ“ Flood service loaded with 11675 road segments from terrain_roads.geojson
```

### 3. Start Frontend (React)
```powershell
cd C:\xampp\htdocs\2025-CP-SafePathZamboanga\SafePathZC\frontend
npm run dev
```
**Expected output:**
```
VITE ready in XXX ms
Local: http://localhost:5173/
```

## How the 3 Routes Work

### Current Implementation
The frontend calls `GET /osrm/route?alternatives=true` which:
1. Queries OSRM for up to 3 alternative routes
2. Each route is **snapped to actual road geometries**
3. Each route is analyzed for flood risk
4. Routes are returned with accurate coordinates and flood percentages

### Route Classification
- **ðŸŸ¢ Safe Route** (Green): Lowest flood percentage
- **ðŸŸ¡ Manageable Route** (Orange): Medium flood percentage
- **ðŸ”´ Flood-Prone Route** (Red): Highest flood percentage (usually fastest)

## Testing Checklist

### âœ… Test 1: OSRM is Running
```powershell
curl "http://localhost:5000/route/v1/driving/122.072655,6.9477795;122.0653243,6.911398"
```
**Expected:** JSON response with route data, distance ~5.5km

### âœ… Test 2: Road Snapping Works
- Start the backend
- Watch console logs when clicking routes
- Should see: `Snapped route: XXX â†’ YYY points`

### âœ… Test 3: Routes Follow Roads Precisely
- Click 2 points on the map
- Verify routes don't cut corners
- Verify routes stay on visible road lines

### âœ… Test 4: Flood Analysis Works
- Routes should show different flood percentages
- Safe route should have lowest percentage
- Red route should have highest percentage

## What's Different Now

### Before
- OSRM used old OpenStreetMap data (didn't match your roads)
- Routes took shortcuts and didn't align with roads
- No road snapping
- Routes went to unnecessary northern areas

### After
- âœ… OSRM uses YOUR `zcroadmap.geojson` roads
- âœ… Routes are snapped to actual road geometries
- âœ… Routes follow visible roads precisely
- âœ… Realistic distances (5-6km instead of 40+km)
- âœ… Accurate flood analysis from `terrain_roads.geojson`

## Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

### If you want MORE distinct routes:
We can implement smart waypoint generation to force OSRM to take different paths based on flood data:
1. Identify high-flood areas
2. Generate waypoints to avoid them for safe route
3. Generate waypoints through them for fast route

This would require creating a new endpoint in `backend/routes/flood_routing.py` (already started but not yet connected to frontend).

## Quick Reference

### OSRM Endpoints
- **Main routing**: `http://localhost:5000/route/v1/driving/{start};{end}`
- **With alternatives**: Add `?alternatives=true`
- **With waypoints**: `{start};{waypoint1};{waypoint2};{end}`

### Backend Endpoints
- **OSRM proxy**: `GET /osrm/route` (with road snapping)
- **Waypoint routes**: `GET /osrm/route-with-waypoints`

### Docker Commands
```powershell
# See running OSRM containers
docker ps --filter "ancestor=osrm/osrm-backend"

# Stop specific container
docker stop <container_id>

# View container logs
docker logs <container_id>

# Restart all services
docker-compose restart
```

## Troubleshooting

### Port 5000 already in use
```powershell
# Find what's using port 5000
docker ps

# Stop all OSRM containers
docker stop $(docker ps --filter "ancestor=osrm/osrm-backend" -q)

# Then start docker-compose
docker-compose up
```

### Routes not snapping to roads
1. Check backend console for "Snapped route" messages
2. Verify OSRM is using `zamboanga_roads.osrm` (check docker-compose logs)
3. Restart backend to reload services

### Flood percentages all the same
1. Verify `terrain_roads.geojson` has flooded roads
2. Check backend console for flood analysis logs
3. Ensure routes are actually different (not same path)

## ðŸŽ‰ System Status: READY

Everything is configured correctly. Just start the 3 services and test! The routes should now:
- âœ… Follow roads precisely
- âœ… Show accurate distances
- âœ… Display correct flood risk percentages
- âœ… Give you 3 distinct routing options
