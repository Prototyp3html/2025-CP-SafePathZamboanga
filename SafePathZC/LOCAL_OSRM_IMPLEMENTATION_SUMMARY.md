# Local OSRM Implementation Summary

## What I've Implemented

I've successfully modified your SafePathZC application to prioritize **local OSRM routing using your Zamboanga PBF file** for all three route types (safe/green, manageable/orange, and flood-prone/red).

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Local OSRM Functions Added**

- `getLocalOSRMRoute()` - Get single route from local OSRM
- `getLocalOSRMAlternativeRoutes()` - Get alternative routes from local OSRM
- `getLocalOSRMRouteWithWaypoint()` - Get route with waypoints from local OSRM
- `getLocalOSRMDistinctRoutes()` - Get all 3 distinct routes using strategic waypoints
- `tryLocalOSRMRouting()` - Local OSRM with timeout and error handling

### 2. **Routing Priority Updated**

```
1. Local OSRM (Zamboanga PBF) ← PRIMARY (Most Accurate)
2. GraphHopper API ← Secondary fallback
3. Public OSRM ← Tertiary fallback
```

### 3. **Smart Route Generation Strategy**

The system now tries to get all three distinct routes from your local OSRM using different waypoint strategies:

- **Safe Route (Green)**: Direct route or northern waypoints (higher elevation preference)
- **Manageable Route (Orange)**: Eastern/western waypoints (alternative highways like Maria Clara L. Lobregat)
- **Flood-Prone Route (Red)**: Southern/coastal waypoints (port areas, downtown coastal roads)

### 4. **Configuration Support**

Environment variables added:

- `VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000`
- `VITE_USE_LOCAL_OSRM=true` (can disable if needed)
- `VITE_GRAPHHOPPER_API_KEY=your_key` (fallback)

### 5. **Enhanced Logging**

Added comprehensive console logging to track:

- Which routing service is being used
- Success/failure of local OSRM attempts
- Fallback service usage
- Route quality indicators

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ When Local OSRM is Working:

```
🗺️ MapView Configuration:
    - Backend URL: http://localhost:8000
    - Use Local OSRM: true
    - Local OSRM endpoint: http://localhost:8000/osrm/route

🚀 Attempting to get all three distinct routes using local OSRM...
✅ Got safe route from local OSRM
✅ Got manageable route from local OSRM
✅ Got flood-prone route from local OSRM
🎉 Successfully got all 3 distinct routes from local OSRM!
```

### 🔄 When Local OSRM Fails:

```
❌ Local OSRM failed, falling back to GraphHopper...
🔄 GraphHopper failed, falling back to public OSRM...
⚠️ WARNING: All real road routing failed, using geometric route as last resort
```

## Benefits You'll Get

1. **🎯 Most Accurate Routes**: Your Zamboanga PBF data provides the most accurate local road network
2. **🚗 Real Road Directions**: All three routes (green/orange/red) now use actual roads instead of geometric lines
3. **🏖️ Better Coastal Routes**: Red route specifically targets coastal/port areas using real roads
4. **🛣️ Highway Alternatives**: Orange route seeks alternative highways and major streets
5. **⚡ Better Performance**: No external API rate limits or timeouts
6. **🔄 Robust Fallbacks**: System gracefully falls back if local OSRM is unavailable

## Next Steps

1. **Start your local OSRM server** in WSL with the Zamboanga PBF file
2. **Start your backend** (it will connect to localhost:5000)
3. **Test the routes** - you should see all three routes using real roads from your local data
4. **Check browser console** for the routing logs to confirm local OSRM usage

The orange and red routes will now be real road directions from your Zamboanga PBF file instead of geometric routes! 🎉
