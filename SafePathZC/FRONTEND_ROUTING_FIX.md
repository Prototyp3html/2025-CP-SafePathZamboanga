# Frontend Routing Fix - Waypoint Bypass Issue Resolved

## Problem Identified

The frontend (`MapView.tsx`) was calling the **wrong endpoint** for routing:

- ‚ùå **BEFORE**: Called `/route` which uses external OSRM (bypasses waypoints)
- ‚úÖ **AFTER**: Now calls `/local-route` which uses your segmented A\* flood-aware routing

## What Was Changed

### File: `frontend/src/components/MapView.tsx`

#### Function: `getLocalOSRMRoute()` (Lines ~2108-2180)

**Before:**

```typescript
const localOSRMUrl = `${BACKEND_URL}/route?start=${start.lng},${start.lat}&end=${end.lng},${end.lat}...`;
```

**After:**

```typescript
const localRouteUrl = `${BACKEND_URL}/local-route?start=${start.lat},${start.lng}&end=${end.lat},${end.lng}...`;
```

### Key Changes:

1. **Endpoint Changed**: `/route` ‚Üí `/local-route`
2. **Parameter Format Fixed**:
   - Start/End now use `lat,lng` (was `lng,lat`)
   - Waypoints still use `lng,lat` format
3. **Response Handling Updated**:
   - Now expects FastAPI format: `{ success: bool, routes: [...], message: string }`
   - Extracts `coordinates` array with `{lat, lng}` objects
   - Handles route_type classification (direct, balanced, safest)

## Why This Fixes the Waypoint Bypass

### The Root Cause:

Your frontend was calling the `/route` endpoint which:

1. Calls external OSRM service
2. Passes waypoints to OSRM in a single request
3. OSRM snaps waypoints to nearest roads and may bypass them if not ideal

### The Solution:

Now calling `/local-route` which:

1. Uses your Python `calculate_hybrid_routes_with_waypoints()` function
2. **Segments the route** (A ‚Üí C, C ‚Üí D, D ‚Üí E, E ‚Üí B)
3. Runs **A\* flood-aware pathfinding** for each segment
4. **Forces routes through waypoints** - cannot bypass!
5. Returns 3 distinct routes: Direct, Balanced, Safest

## Backend Endpoint Expected Format

The `/local-route` endpoint expects:

```
GET /local-route?start=6.9214,122.0790&end=6.9100,122.0850&waypoints=122.0800,6.9150;122.0820,6.9120
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "routes": [
    {
      "label": "direct",
      "risk_profile": "prone",
      "coordinates": [{"lat": 6.9214, "lng": 122.0790}, ...],
      "distance": 1234.56,
      "duration": 567.89
    },
    // ... balanced and safest routes
  ],
  "message": "Successfully calculated 3 route(s) with waypoints"
}
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Start Backend:**

   ```bash
   cd C:\xampp\htdocs\2025-CP-SafePathZamboanga\SafePathZC\backend
   python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload
   ```

2. **Start Frontend:**

   ```bash
   cd C:\xampp\htdocs\2025-CP-SafePathZamboanga\SafePathZC\frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test Route Planning:**
   - Open the map and plan a route with waypoints
   - Check browser console for: `üöÄ Using FastAPI /local-route (A* flood-aware routing)`
   - Verify waypoints are now ENFORCED in the route path

## Expected Console Output

**Before (Broken):**

```
üó∫Ô∏è Local OSRM URL: http://localhost:8001/route?...
‚ö†Ô∏è Point C NOT found in route! Waypoint is at lng=122.0722655, lat=6.947780
```

**After (Fixed):**

```
üöÄ Using FastAPI /local-route (A* flood-aware routing): http://localhost:8001/local-route?...
‚úÖ FastAPI Success: Got 234 waypoints, simplified to 89 for flood-aware route (direct)
```

## Additional Notes

- The backend's `calculate_hybrid_routes_with_waypoints()` function now properly segments routes
- Each segment uses A\* search with flood risk weights
- Waypoints cannot be bypassed because routing is forced segment-by-segment
- All routes are analyzed for flood risk based on terrain GeoJSON data

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Backend `/local-route` endpoint created
- [x] Frontend updated to call `/local-route` instead of `/route`
- [x] Parameter formats corrected (lat,lng vs lng,lat)
- [x] Response parsing updated for FastAPI format
- [x] Waypoint enforcement verified in backend
- [ ] Test with actual waypoints in UI (next step)
