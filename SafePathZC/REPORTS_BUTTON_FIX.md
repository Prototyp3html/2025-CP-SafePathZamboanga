# Reports Button Update Fix âœ…

## Problem

The "Reports" button on the map was showing "Reports (0)" even though the report markers were appearing on the map correctly. The count wasn't updating after the reports were fetched.

## Root Cause

The button text was set **once** during map initialization:

```typescript
text.innerText = `Reports (${communityReports.length})`; // communityReports was empty []
```

At initialization time, `communityReports` was an empty array, so it showed "0". When the reports were fetched later via the API, the markers were displayed but the button text was never updated.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added a Ref to Store the Text Element

```typescript
const reportsButtonTextRef = useRef<HTMLSpanElement | null>(null);
```

### 2. Stored the Reference During Button Creation

When creating the reports button control, we now store a reference to the text span:

```typescript
reportsButtonTextRef.current = text;
```

### 3. Added useEffect to Update on Reports Change

Created a new useEffect that updates the button text whenever reports are fetched:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (reportsButtonTextRef.current) {
    reportsButtonTextRef.current.innerText = `Reports (${communityReports.length})`;
  }
}, [communityReports.length]);
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Map Initializes** â†’ Button shows "Reports (0)"
2. **fetchCommunityReports() runs** â†’ Fetches 8 reports from API
3. **communityReports state updates** â†’ Array now has 8 items
4. **useEffect triggers** â†’ Detects `communityReports.length` changed from 0 to 8
5. **Button text updates** â†’ Changes to "Reports (8)"
6. **Markers appear** â†’ All 8 report markers display on map

## Changes Made

**File Modified:** `frontend/src/components/MapView.tsx`

**Lines Changed:**

- Added `reportsButtonTextRef` ref (around line 976)
- Stored text element in ref during button creation (around line 7765)
- Added useEffect to update button text (around line 1353)

## Test It

1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+R or F5)
2. **Wait 1-2 seconds** for reports to load
3. **Watch the button** change from "Reports (0)" to "Reports (8)"
4. **The markers** should also appear on the map

The button text now dynamically updates as reports are fetched! ðŸŽ‰

## Additional Benefits

This fix also means:

- âœ… The count will update automatically if new reports are created
- âœ… The count will update when reports are refreshed (every 5 minutes)
- âœ… No need to refresh the page to see the correct count
- âœ… Real-time synchronization between data and UI

## Technical Details

**Pattern Used:** Ref + useEffect Pattern

- **Ref** stores a reference to a DOM element that exists outside React's normal rendering
- **useEffect** watches for state changes and updates the DOM element directly
- This is a common pattern for updating Leaflet controls that are created outside React's component tree
