## Weather Detection Logic

### **API Integration:**

```typescript
// WeatherAPI.com configuration
const WEATHER_API_KEY = "11b60f9fe8df4418a12152441251310";
const LOCATION = "Zamboanga City, Philippines";

// Endpoint
https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/forecast.json
```

### **Alert Generation Thresholds:**

| Condition         | Threshold       | Alert Type          | Severity |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------- | -------- |
| Extreme Rain      | > 20mm/hr       | Severe Flooding     | HIGH     |
| Heavy Rain        | 10-20mm/hr      | Moderate Flooding   | MODERATE |
| Light Rain        | 5-10mm/hr       | Minor Flooding Risk | LOW      |
| Very Strong Winds | > 60kph         | Strong Wind Warning | HIGH     |
| Moderate Winds    | 40-60kph        | Wind Advisory       | MODERATE |
| Storms            | Codes 1087-1282 | Storm Alert         | HIGH     |

### **Smart Recommendations:**

#### **Extreme Conditions (>20mm rain):**

- Avoid all non-essential travel
- Stay in safe elevated areas
- Monitor emergency broadcasts
- Have evacuation plan ready

#### **Heavy Rain (10-20mm):**

- Exercise extreme caution when traveling
- Avoid flood-prone areas
- Drive slowly and maintain safe distance
- Keep emergency contacts accessible

#### **Moderate Rain (5-10mm):**

- Drive carefully in wet conditions
- Allow extra travel time
- Use headlights even during daytime

#### **Strong Winds (>40kph):**

- Secure all loose outdoor objects
- Watch for falling branches or debris
- Avoid exposed areas and coastal roads

## Backend Integration

### **Community Reports Endpoint:**

```typescript
GET http://localhost:8001/api/reports/approved

Response Format:
[
  {
    "id": 123,
    "type": "flood",
    "severity": "high",
    "location": "Canelar Road",
    "description": "Road impassable due to flooding",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-14T10:30:00Z",
    "reported_by": "Juan Dela Cruz",
    "verified_by": "Admin Team",
    "status": "active",
    "affected_routes": ["Route A12", "Route B45"],
    "weather_conditions": {
      "temp_c": 28,
      "precip_mm": 15.2,
      "wind_kph": 25
    }
  }
]
```

### **Current Implementation (Simulated):**

```typescript
try {
  const reportsResponse = await fetch(
    "http://localhost:8001/api/reports/approved"
  );
  if (reportsResponse.ok) {
    const communityReports = await reportsResponse.json();
    // Process and display reports
  }
} catch (error) {
  // Graceful fallback - shows only weather alerts
  console.log("Community reports not available:", error);
}
```
