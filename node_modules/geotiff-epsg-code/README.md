# geotiff-epsg-code
Get the EPSG Code for a GeoTIFF.

# why
ESRI software often doesn't use standards.  A GeoTIFF file will sometimes have an ESRI Well-Known Text string baked into its metadata, but no EPSG Code set.  This library will do the work for you of finding a valid EPSG code corresponding to the projection information.

# install
```bash
npm install geotiff-epsg-code
```

# usage
```js
import { fromUrl } from "geotiff";
import get_epsg_code from "geotiff-epsg-code";

const tif = await fromUrl("https://example.org/satellite_imagery.tif");

await get_epsg_code(tif);
